_____________________________________________________________________________________
‚úÖ v0.2 Updates =

- Reworked the script and made things cleaner and easier to use.

- Added manual .nfo download mode ‚Äî simply enter one or more release names.
- Now uses https://srrdb.com as the main NFO source, with https://predb.net as a fallback.
- Reworked the menu to include all possible task combinations (1 through 15).
- Added the ability to run another task directly after the current one finishes, removing the need to restart the script.
- Fixed a bug that incorrectly moved non-gamerip releases to _gamerips. (such as rGPDA etc.)
- Improved logging: now only shows actual errors in ProcessErrorLog.txt.
- Coloured console output for improved readability.
